The length of the array s is not necessary in get1ine sinceits size is set in main. get1ine uses return to send a value back to the caller, just as the function power did. This line also declares that getline returns an int; since int is the default return type, it could be omitted. Some functions return a useful value; others, like copy, are used only for their effect and return no value. The return type of copy is void, which states explicitly that no value is returned.getline puts the character ' \0' (the null character, whose value is zero)at the end of the array it is creating, to mark the end of the string of characters.This conventionis also used by the C language: when a string constant likeThe functions get1ine and copy are declared at the beginning of the program, which we assume is contained in one file.main and get1ine communicate through a pair of arguments and areturnedvalue. In get1ine, the arguments are declared by the lineint qetline(char s[], int lim)which specifiesthat the first argument, s, is an array, and the second, lim, isan integer. The purpose of supplying the size of an array in a declaration is toset aside storage.
